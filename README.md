## -----------------------  Eight Queens -----------------------------
Put eight queens is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; 
thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal and calculate how many solutions the problem has.  
There are two versions of the program: non recursize - with nested loops, and recursive. Recursive version can deal with chess board of eny size.
```
eight_queensR.py - recursive version
eight_queensNR.py- non recursive version
```
## ------------------------------ Vortex Matrix -------------------------
Print given matrix starting from the corner by spiral with last printer in the center of the matrix. 
For the maxtrix 
```
[[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]]
It will be: 
1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10 
```
## ------------------------- Lucky Tickts ------------------------------
Calculate number of "Lucky Tickets". Each ticket has a 6 digits number. If summ of the first 3 digits is 
equal to the sum of the last 3 digits, ticket is "Lucky".

Program contains several versions (all in one file).
The answer is 55252 tickets
