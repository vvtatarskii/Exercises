Put eight queens is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; 
thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal and calculate how many solutions the problem has.  
There are two versions of the program: non recursize - with nested loops, and recursive. Recursive version can deal with chess board of eny size.
eight_queensR.py - recursive version
eight_queensNR.py- non recursive version
